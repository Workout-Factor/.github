<h1>Welcome to Workout Factor.</h1>
<hr />
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>
  We are two forward-thinking, passionate gym bros with over 25 years of combined experience in fitness training. Having realized a need for more simple, quality, and unbiased information about the industry’s most frequently asked questions, we created Workout Factor.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>Our aim</h3>
<p>Workout Factor rests on four main pillars, primarily formed to combat the misinformation and marketing ploys of the fitness industry.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>1. Straight to the point</h4>
    <p>First, we aim to be your all-in-one fitness hub from the latest scientifically proven training, workouts, nutritional plans, and fitness calculators—all unbiased, unfiltered, and straight from the source in a digestible format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>2. Thriving Community</h4>
     <p>Secondly, we aim to create a social network of gym bros and gals where everyone can find the mental support to begin lifting or to push past those stubborn plateaus. It can be challenging to have your gym buddy join during your night owl lifts; however, you can always count on our community as your spotter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>3. Specialized market</h4>
    <p>Thirdly, we aim to have a store (very shortly) where our hand-picked products will be featured. The marketing maze of ploys and misinformation used by big brands to steal your hard-earned cash is immense in this sport. We will feature our carefully vetted products to cut through the marketing lies, so you don’t need to waste countless hours on finding the best supplements and gear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>4. Plans and guides</h4>
    <p>Fourth, we want to motivate beginner lifters to take up the sport. We support all newbies with our tailored workout plans, individual guidance, and a network of motivated and friendly gym buddies to empower you to take the first step, stick with the sport, and attain your ambitions.</p>
  </li>
